**Operation Analytics and Investigating Metric Spike - K Vikram Sundar**

**Project Description:**
The goal of this project is to retrieve the operational analytics report for end-to-end operations of a companyâ€™s operations.
We also take a deep dive into investigation of the metric spike of user engagement on a daily and weekly basis to identify trends and patterns to make better data driven decisions. 

**Approach:** 
We gather all the relevant data and import into MySQL database and validate all the columns and their data types. Then we use SQL to write optimized queries along with aggregation and window functions to perform the analysis and retrieve the result set which gives us a clear understanding of the metrics analysis and will be considered to further make business driven decisions.

**Tools/Technologies Used:**
In this project , we use MySQL Workbench as the primary tool to gather relevant insights from the given dataset. We use SQL queries to communicate with the database which contains the data from the dataset to retrieve only the data which we require based on the requirement from the marketing team.

**Insights:**
Learnt how to use SQL queries by writing concise and optimized queries and also gained knowledge on several functions being used in MySQL to gather data effectively. The inferences made from the data are present in the below page.

**Result:**
To identify trends and patterns in the daily or weekly metrics analysis to understand whether the overall engagement is positive or negative over a period of time to understand the areas of improvement to increase the overall engagement rate.

**Overall Learning and Progress:**
Clear understanding on how to write optimized SQL queries by using aggregate and window functions.
